The tools in this directory are designed to help do a 32-bit kernel
compile on a 64-bit x86 platform.

When building dtrace, life is easier if I can cross-compile
the driver on a single box (rather than flipping between two
cpu architectures on different boxes), and at least validate that
it can compile on my collection of kernels.

It may not work for you - we dont really care, at this stage, about
the quality of a cross-compiled driver, since the driver needs to be
built with the same linux/.config options as your target.

We arent in the business of putting out binary distributions (maybe
at a later date), but thats a support nightmare, and not GPL friendly.

Its possible that some of this does more or more bad things than it needs,
but this is the hoops I had to go through to get the same errors/warnings
as my native 32-bit machine was getting.

This is needed when the 

	$ make kernels

target is invoked.
