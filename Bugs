This file will be a bug track list of issues as I detect them or
people report them, and a sign off that the issue is resolved.


Items marked with an 'x' are 'DONE' and signed off.

x 20080708 1. dtrace -f open
           Prove we can see cpu2
           Had forced 'cpu = 0' in dtrace_state_buffer() because we
           we hitting an assertion.
  
x 20080708 2. dtrace -f open:entry -- failing probe lookup
           Same as apple dtrace. Seems to be a bug in dtrace itself.
  
x 20080708 3. dtrace -f syscall::open:entry -- failing probe lookup
           dtrace itself is broken in the way it parses this. This works
	   'dtrace -f syscall::open'

  20080708 4. wade thru variables lookup
  20080708 5. validate ustack/stack
x  20080708 6. fastrap
            Merged and compiled, but other bug issues to resolve.

  20080708 7. fix dtrace -l being erratic on driver reloads
  20080708 8. implement hashing on par_alloc.
  20080708 9. dtrace -s tests/dt010
              hangs system

  20080708 10. BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 11s! [dtrace:5862]
             Our timer callbacks arent correct so they can hang/kill the
	     system. (Broken cyclic.c code?)

x 20080708 11. dtrace -s tests/dt011
  		Invokes CPU_DTRACE_BADADDR from dtrace_copycheck because
		we have no base range for the kernel. Use validate_ptr.

		Fixed dtrace_copycheck() which assumed Solaris kernelbase
		which we dont have. Still get occasional bad pointers
		in open() syscalls, but that might be real bugs somewhere!

x 20080712 12. dtrace -s tests/dt013
             can cause stack tracing on kernel.

  20080723 13. kmem_cache_create in dtrace_attach being called twice
               or not being freed on driver unload?

x 20080723 14. sys_call_table not visible in 2.6.23.1.

  20080729 15. proc2.c: Set pr_dmodel for 64b machine.

x 20081009 16. Build drti.o so that dtrace -G can work.
	        Done

x 20081010 17. Build /dev/dtrace-helper function needed by dtrace -G.
               Done

x  20081019 18. fasttrap_attach() call in fasttrap.c takes us into new
	territory which breaks us. Need to init the mutexes in fasttrap_attach.
	Done.

  20081026 19. dtrace -P fbt
               Panics the kernel, but likely due to intercepting stuff we 
	       shouldnt be allowed to.
