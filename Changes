       2* drivers/dtracedrv.ko finally links correctly. However theres still
          quite a few stubs and broken definitions, so be careful - will
	  likely crash your kernel.

       1* dt_lex.l: Fix flex/lex issues - now parses strings properly and
           dtrace -x nolibs -n BEGIN -e -S
	   seems to work - or at least it doesnt core dump or generate
	   a diagnostic.
