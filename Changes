       8* Archive: 1.0006

       7* Put all binaries into the build/ dir rather than littering the
          source. Not done for drivers yet, since Linux kernel build
	  pollutes us. Also made code do a clean build from start to finish.
	  Ignore warnings - will address these over the course of time.

       6* Archive: 1.0005

       5* Various changes for clean build on FC8/2.6.24.4 kernel. Slightly
          broken Ubuntu...to fix next. First part of the driver works, and
	  making some changes to allow cmd/dtrace to talk to the driver.

       4* Surprise: my first kernel panic. /dev/dtrace is the interface
          and if you cat it ... surprise !

       3* Now builds under ubuntu 2.6.22-14-generic kernel and
          RedHat FC* 2.6.24.4-64.fc8. More portability.

	  If you load the driver, you will have 

	  /proc/dtrace/helper
	  /proc/dtrace/dtrace

	  entries. (Non functional since no plumbing at present).

       2* drivers/dtracedrv.ko finally links correctly. However theres still
          quite a few stubs and broken definitions, so be careful - will
	  likely crash your kernel.

       1* dt_lex.l: Fix flex/lex issues - now parses strings properly and
           dtrace -x nolibs -n BEGIN -e -S
	   seems to work - or at least it doesnt core dump or generate
	   a diagnostic.
