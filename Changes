      28* fbt_linux.c, dtrace_linux.c: Implement a validate_ptr() function
          since we were dying due to bad VM inside the kernel.

Mon Jun  2 21:42:23 2008  fox

      27* fbt_linux.c: Avoid issue with call to __symbol_get() cause
          incremented mod ref count, which stops us unloading.

      25* dtrace_linux.c: Create the cpu_list[] structure which dtrace wants.
          Avoids kernel panic when we hit DTRACEIOC_GO.

      24* drivers/dtrace/dtrace.c: More merge-in from ON solaris.

      22* drivers/dtrace/dtrace_ioctl.c: Remove this - integrate back in
          with dtrace.c since we are now more aligned and nearly working.

      21* drivers/dtrace/*: Fix issue where 'dtrace -l' would keep
          adding the same probes. Needed to mimic the init/attach/open
	  cycle of a proper solaris driver. Fixed various crashes due
	  to this, and allows driver to unload properly - no issues in simple
	  testing, but basic probe placement is not working yet - cannot 
	  plant the probes. Not sure why..yet.

      20* drivers/dtrace.c: Update to latest opensolaris code to help
          find bugs in driver.

      18* cmd/dtrace/dtrace.c: Incorporate getopt() fixes from Apple/Darwin.
          Fixes 'dtrace -n BEGIN', but note this will presently crash your
	  kernel if you run it !

Tue May 13 21:56:09 2008  fox

      17* cmd/dtrace/dtrace.c: Fix issue with getopt() not working when
          presented with this command line:

	  cmd/dtrace/dtrace cmd/dtrace/demo/agg/denorm.d /bin/ls

      16* Update the cmd/dtrace demo to the latest version. They broke
          backwards compatibility ! Why ?! The #pragma changed syntax.
	  Thats very very naughty of them. I do hate lex+flex.

Sun May 11 20:54:47 2008  fox

      15* Update libdtrace to latest opensolaris version.
          Update cmd/dtrace/dtrace.c to latest verison.

      14* /dev/ctf driver now loads but theres lots of inter-driver
          dependencies which are a pain to manage, so may try
	  and create a consolidated driver.

      12* Archive: 1.0008

      11* Fix dt_lex.l and dt_grammar.y compile fixed so we dont copy
          files from my install tree to the remote install tree.
	  Fixes problem with dtrace plainly not working at all.

      10* dt_grammar.y: Some minor tweaks to handle compiling with
          bison. Sun have an error in their file (missing ';').

       8* Archive: 1.0006

       7* Put all binaries into the build/ dir rather than littering the
          source. Not done for drivers yet, since Linux kernel build
	  pollutes us. Also made code do a clean build from start to finish.
	  Ignore warnings - will address these over the course of time.

       6* Archive: 1.0005

       5* Various changes for clean build on FC8/2.6.24.4 kernel. Slightly
          broken Ubuntu...to fix next. First part of the driver works, and
	  making some changes to allow cmd/dtrace to talk to the driver.

Mon Apr 21 22:10:40 2008  fox

       4* Surprise: my first kernel panic. /dev/dtrace is the interface
          and if you cat it ... surprise !

Sun Apr 20 20:51:52 2008  fox

       3* Now builds under ubuntu 2.6.22-14-generic kernel and
          RedHat FC* 2.6.24.4-64.fc8. More portability.

	  If you load the driver, you will have 

	  /proc/dtrace/helper
	  /proc/dtrace/dtrace

	  entries. (Non functional since no plumbing at present).

Sat Apr 19 23:08:09 2008  fox

       2* drivers/dtracedrv.ko finally links correctly. However theres still
          quite a few stubs and broken definitions, so be careful - will
	  likely crash your kernel.

Wed Apr  9 21:56:09 2008  fox

       1* dt_lex.l: Fix flex/lex issues - now parses strings properly and
           dtrace -x nolibs -n BEGIN -e -S
	   seems to work - or at least it doesnt core dump or generate
	   a diagnostic.
