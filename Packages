List of packages needed to build the kernel. You may have these
installed already, but, for example, with Ubuntu, by default most
dev libs are not installed. Fedora Code is better in this respect
as the install DVD contains everything you need.

elfutils -- provides <gelf.h>

libelf-dev
	libelf1 development libraries and header files

bison-1.35 or byacc
	Needed to compile the D language grammar file. dt_grammar.y

lex or flex
	Needed to compile dt_lex.l

zlib
	Need compression header file -- zlib.h and libz.so.1
