List of packages needed to build the kernel. You may have these
installed already, but, for example, with Ubuntu, by default most
dev libs are not installed. Fedora Code is better in this respect
as the install DVD contains everything you need.

elfutils -- provides <gelf.h>

libelf-dev
	libelf1 development libraries and header files
	http://www.mr511.de/software/ has libelf 0.8.10 sources.
	You may need this for symtabs to work properly.

bison-1.35 or byacc
	Needed to compile the D language grammar file. dt_grammar.y

lex or flex
	Needed to compile dt_lex.l

librt.so
	Needed for the clock_gettime() function so we can implement
	gethrtime().

zlib
	Need compression header file -- zlib.h and libz.so.1
