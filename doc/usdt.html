<b>User Defined Tracing - How it works</b>

<p>
USDT is a mechanism for user land applications to embed their
own probes into executables. For example, a Perl or Python 
interpreter might use it to gain access to stack traces of applications
which are already started.

<p>
The goal of the DTrace team was near zero overhead when not invoked.
This works well - even commercial applications can embed
probes and not worry about performance or run time dependencies.

<p>
There are a number of steps to make this work.

<p>
Heres an example:

<pre>
# include &lt;stdio.h>
# include &lt;sys/sdt.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	while (1) {
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__line, 0x1234);
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__word, 0x87654321);
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		DTRACE_PROBE1(simple, saw__word, 0xdeadbeef);
		printf("here on line %d\n", __LINE__);
		sleep(1);
		}
}
</pre>


<p>
The DTRACE_PROBEx macros translate into a function call.
To gain near-zero overhead, during linking, the function call
is replaced by a series of NOP instructions. Heres an example disassembly
of the above

<p>
When an application is built, dtrace is run on the
object files to rewrite the objects, stubbing out the calls
for probes, and creating a table in the executable of the
places where the stubs are located. (The code
for this is located in libdtrace/dt_link.c).

<p>
When the application is started up, a piece of code is
executed (before main() is called). [Code located in
libdtrace/drti.c]. This code looks at the current system,
to see if dtrace is loaded into the kernel and communicates
with the /dev/dtrace/helper driver to inform it that new
probes are available in this process.

<p>
Voila! We are done. Or nearly.

<p>
At this point, whilst the application is running, 'dtrace -l'
should reveal your new probes.

<b>The Kernel</b>

When a user elects to monitor the probe, the patched (NOP-ed) code
will be change into a call back into the kernel to notify the
function/probe is being invoked.

Cancellation of the probe will undo the patched code and we are done.
