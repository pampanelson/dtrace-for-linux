This document describes the security settings for dtrace, as 
implemente for Linux. 

dtrace allows a user to access physical memory of the kernel and
other processes, and, as such, should not be allowed in an untrusted
environment. The driver allows various settings to control what a user
can do.

dtrace_proc
dtrace_user
dtrace_kernel
dtrace_super

The /dev/dtrace interface is used to communicate the security settings.
The idea is that on driver load, a set of security records are
sent to the driver, which define users and groups vs the priviledges allowed.

	$ echo dtrace_proc all
	$ echo dtrace_proc none
	$ echo dtrace_proc 200 201 202 ...
