This directory contains the kernel code. We have a number
of drivers here, corresponding to the Solaris dtrace /dev
area. Major files are Solaris source code, with appropriate (small)
changes for working under Linux.

Other files, are linux drop-ins to complete the circle of
bits needed to create a solaris driver.

We no longer build in the source tree, since Linux kernel builder
deposits lots of build output files here, but we build in the
build-`uname -r`/ tree instead, so that output files are
segregated from the input sources.
