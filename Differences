This document describes differences between Solaris Dtrace and Linux
Dtrace. These differences occur because the kenerl or system calling
conventions work differently.

Where possible, attempts will be made to provide some form of
portability so that D scripts can be more portable.

1. System call returns

In Solaris, you can do:

	syscall::open:return
	/arg1 == -1/
	{
	}

But in Linux, a syscall returns -errno value and not -1. GLIBC is
responsible for setting the return of a syscall to -1 and updating the
errno value. 

Linux dtrace maps a < 0 arg0 return to -1, and arg1 can be used
to gain the raw value from the return.
