Linux port of DTrace

This is a pre-alpha, work-in-progress port of Sun's DTrace kernel
debugging tool for Linux. It is not prime-time and much of it
doesnt compile.

I have taken a variety of approaches to get where I am:

custom include dir: 

	- <linux> for user land tools which front-ends /usr/include and
	  /usr/include/sys
	- <sys> for the kernel drivers.

makefiles are incomplete - I use 'makefile' and will clean up Suns
Makefile and Makefile.targ and other extraneous subdirs to simplify things.

make-me is a temporary script to build the kernel drivers.

No top-level makefile at present. In cmd/dtrace/dtrace is a 64-bit dtrace
binary built on RedHat FC8. Will remove that and make it buildable.

Kernel drivers assume access to /usr/src/linux -- needs to be fixed.
kernel drivers dont compile yet. Lots of use of 

	# if defined(sun)
	...
	# endif

for bits we wont want (much cribbed from the FreeBSD port).

Some code has

	# if linux
	...
	#endif

where its definitely Linux time.

No GPL code in here at present; all CDDL.

'tags' files are CRiSP format cross-reference files. If you dont have
CRiSP, delete them and build your own !

If you see 'warn' in a makefile, its a tool which color codes gcc
warnings and errors and makes it easier to read the output. It also
knows how to hide the exceptionally annoying non-warning output lines
which are impossible to fix in real life code without a gazillion
of compiler flags.
